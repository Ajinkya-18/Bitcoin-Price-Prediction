# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
A dataset from Kaggle was used to train the model on 3 algorithms viz- Logistic Regression, SVC and XGBoost Classifier.
All three of them resulted in an accuracy of more than 98% for both training and testing sets.
[If possible, will share the link to the dataset as uploading it here is not possible due to large file size.]
