# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
A dataset from Kaggle was used to train a model to predict whether the bitcoin price will rise or fall on 3 algorithms viz- Logistic Regression, SVC and XGBoost Classifier.
All three resulted in more than 98% accuracy for both training and testing sets.
[If possible, will share the link to the dataset as uploading it here is impossible due to the large file size.]
